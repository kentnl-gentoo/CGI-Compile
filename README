NAME
    CGI::Compile - Compile .cgi scripts to a code reference like
    ModPerl::Registry

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI::Compile;
      my $sub = CGI::Compile->compile("/path/to/script.cgi");

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Compile is an utility to compile CGI scripts into a code reference
    that can run many times on its own namespace, as long as the script is
    ready to run on a persistent environment.

RUN ON PSGI
    Combined with CGI::Emulate::PSGI, your CGI script can be turned into a
    persistent PSGI application like:

      use CGI::Emulate::PSGI;
      use CGI::Compile;

      my $cgi_script = "/path/to/foo.cgi";
      my $sub = CGI::Compile->compile($cgi_script);
      my $app = CGI::Emulate::PSGI->handler($sub);

      # $app is a PSGI application
